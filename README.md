# [BlendCSS](http://grannycookies.github.io/blend/examples/): An unique & expressive front-end web framework.

BlendCSS blends the best parts of Material Design and Flat 2.0 to create a unique design language that really screams "You!" at the top of it's lungs.

![You!](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/GrannyCookies/blend/gh-pages/examples/You!.png)

With BlendCSS, expressive classnames are an integral focus, creating source code that can actually be read by people.

```html
<a class='blue button that-ripples'>
	Click me!
</a>
```
