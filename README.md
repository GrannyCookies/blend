BlendCSS blends the best parts of Material Design and Flat 2.0 to create a unique design language that really screams "You!" at the top of it's lungs.

![You!](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/GrannyCookies/blend/gh-pages/examples/You!.png)

Expressive classnames are an integral component, meaning that your  source code that can actually be read by people who have no idea what `<header class="navbar navbar-static-top bs-docs-nav" id="top" role="banner">` means.

```html
<a class='blue button that-ripples'>
	Click me!
</a>
```
